### Project Description
The Smart Attendance System is a cloud-based solution designed to automate attendance tracking for educational institutions. It leverages AWS services including AWS VPC, AWS RDS (MySQL), AWS EC2, AWS Security Groups, AWS Route Tables, AWS NACLs, and AWS IAM to store and manage attendance data securely. The system features a web interface, launched using an EC2 instance, for logging in, marking attendance, viewing records, and downloading reports as CSV files. The backend is built with Node.js, connecting to an RDS MySQL database hosted in a custom VPC for data privacy and scalability. The frontend, developed with React, offers a user-friendly dashboard with tabs for marking attendance and viewing reports.
